# classic-launchpad
A web launchpad for classic computers

As a collector of (mainly) beige Macintoshes I wanted to have a convenient start page for those 
+ that renders fine in old browsers
+ gives me links to some web resources that work in those old machines, too (keep in mind, ssl is usually not working for them)
+ and mainly gives me a super fast search entry for macintoshgarden.org which is an absolutely awesome project I love ... but it renders often slowly on the target group machines. With the Launchpad you get directly to the search result saving a lot of time for the initial render.

## Build
I built this in an old fashioned way with pure php, no css and no javascript. 
+ Just install nginx or Apache and PHP
+ Put the files from /src into the webroot
+ Make the address of your webserver the startpage of any Netscape Navigator 2.0 or which ever browser you like
+ Enjoy
